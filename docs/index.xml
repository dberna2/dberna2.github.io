      <description>&lt;p&gt;Throughout my experience in software development, I‚Äôve learned that one of the main things to keep in mind is how the code we write will be tested. And not just that ‚Äî it‚Äôs also crucial to ensure that the tests actually work as they should, rather than just creating tests to meet a code coverage percentage and avoid issues with Sonar rules üòÖ.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At some point, we‚Äôve all written our own tests, and over time we‚Äôve found strategies that help us develop them more effectively. However, I‚Äôve also seen that when deadlines start to tighten in a project, two main things often happen:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wowwwww.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am just awed by the support and turnout from this community.  You all just totally blew me away.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for everyone who voted, read, shared, attened, and asked.  While the current board still needs to approve my election next month for my term beginning July I&amp;rsquo;m not going to lose any momentum. I already have a list of things to research and understand better, and I look forward to start building relationships with the team.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Checkstyle for Java using GitHub Action and Reviewdog</title>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;reviewdog--github-actions-enforce-team-agreements-without-breaking-your-flow&#34;&gt;ReviewDog + GitHub Actions: enforce team agreements without breaking your flow&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Code style agreements are essential for long-term maintainability. But in most teams, enforcing them is tricky: warnings get ignored, and blocking the CI for every style rule can feel excessive. That‚Äôs where ReviewDog shines.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This setup uses ReviewDog in combination with CheckStyle and GitHub Actions to surface violations directly in pull requests ‚Äî without interrupting builds. Developers get inline comments tied to their changes, keeping the review focused on business logic while still catching style issues early.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
